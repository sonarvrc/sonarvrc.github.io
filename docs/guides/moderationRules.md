# Rules and guidelines
This page describes guidelines for enforcing the rules in instance during events. Note that ultimately the details of enforcement are up to the moderator(s) handling the case.

## Performance rating
- We enforce a strict "poor or better" avatar rule, going by the rating on PC.
- This rule also counts for performers, unless they are currently actively doing a performance. The exception only counts for performers that have been officially admitted as performers for this event, which will be communicated between staff. Please remind them to change after their performance is over if they seem to have forgotten.
- When the amount of people in the instance is low and/or performance is good, moderation for this rule may be relaxed. Please coordinate this between all staff on shift.
- Some avatars with a poor or better rating might still significantly affect performance, if this is noticed please inform the wearer and politely ask them to change. Depending on severity and who is/isn't affected this can be forced or only suggested.

## Age
- SONAR is a strictly 18+ group, no exceptions.
- VRChat age verification or stated age/DoB in a persons bio can be assumed to be accurate, unless voice/behaviour very clearly says otherwise.
- In the past exceptions have been made for performers but it has since been decided to abandon these and not allow new exceptions to be made. So: no exceptions.

## Explicit content
- Despite being strictly 18+, we do not allow explicit content. This includes sexual, violent, and gory material.
- Sexual material for avatars is a very difficult line to draw. In general, for human avatars anything less than beachwear is not allowed. For other types of avatars please use your own judgement and/or ask other staff in the instance.
- ERP is strictly disallowed. Please plan your resources elsewhere.

## Hostility
- We do not allow hostility towards other people, which includes slurs, offensive gestures, bullying, disrespecting staff, etc.
- This also includes offending text or visuals in names, banners, statusses, or avatars.
- It is surprisingly common for trolls to run around an instance yelling slurs, this warrants an instant kick with no verbal warning necessary. (These people will often ignore any warnings anyway.)
- Do not hesitate to moderate someone for insulting or disrespecting you while you are performing your duties.

## Disruption
- We do not want people to disrupt the event for others, which includes pestering staff/performers, interrupting conversations, playing music, etc.
- Minor infractions include continuous OSC chatboxes for any other purpose than accessibility, avatar sounds, large avatars (especially near the front of the venue), and screenspace shaders.

## Conversational topics
- We encourage people to not discuss politics, violence, drug abuse, or other topics that could ordinarily require a trigger warning.
- This is not a hard rule but a general guideline. If you think a particular conversation goes too far please discuss with other staff in the instance.
