# Moderation Guide
Welcome to the SONAR XR Moderation Guide. This document provides an overview of the moderation policies and procedures to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for all community members.

## Short role description
As a SONAR instance moderator, you are responsible for enforcing our group rules and norms in VRChat instances hosted by the group, as well as answering any questions visitors at our events may have.

## Onboarding
### Requirements
Our main requirements for moderators are:
- You are at least 18 years old or age of majority in your country, whichever is higher;
- You are in the Discord server (for communication);
- You visit the events on a PC platform (Windows or Linux) (for avatar ratings and general performance);
- Your schedule is predictable enough to sign up a couple days ahead of events.

### Process
After creating a ticket, the commander of moderation (see [Staff list](https://sonarvrc.github.io/docs/roleDescriptions/0_staffList.html)) will schedule a voice call or VRC meetup with you to to ask and answer any questions about the role and your suitability. If that goes well, and the rest of staff also has no objections, you will be given the **@Staff** and **@Event Moderation** roles in the Discord server, and are invited to the SONAR Staff VRC group. Your first event you will be shadowing an existing moderator (likely the commander) to see what a usual shift looks like and answer any remaining questions. And if that goes well: welcome to the team!

## How to
### Singing up
For every event a call for moderation sign-ups will be released by the moderation manager for that event (usually the commander of moderation) in **[#mod-signup](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1266820389149868074)** at least several days before the event. Each event is split into slots that usually correspond to full hours and/or DJ slots, to sign up for one just react an emoji to the corresponding message (pick a unique one for clarity). You can sign up to all the slots you can be available for, the moderation manager will try to limit the amount of slots you'll actually be assigned, also taking other factors into account (eg double roles)[1]. The moderation schedule is announced one or more days before the event. If you are assigned a shift you are expected to attend it unless you notify the moderation manager in advance.

[1]: In general the target is 2 moderators per slot, and max 2 hours per moderator (preferably consecutive). Staff with double roles (such as moderation and media) will never be assigned alone. The event host will only be assigned moderation duty if absolutely necessary. DJs cannot moderate their own DJ slot (you know who you are).

### Starting your shift
Your shift starts at the time indicated in the final schedule posted in the **[#mod-signup](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1266820389149868074)** thread, please attempt to be in the instance a couple minutes before this time. Once you're in the instance, prepare by making sure you are in an appropriate avatar/outfit, representing the SONAR Staff group banner, and joining the **[#Staff com](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1257352779396288543)** voicechat. Also try to find the other moderator(s) in the instance to communicate if anything happened during the previous slot and how you will work this slot.
If you can't be in the instance on time please inform the other staff in the **[#mod-signup](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1266820389149868074)** thread *before your slot starts*.

### During the shift
The key responsibilities for a moderator during a normal event are the following: 
- Inform people that are wearing avatars with a "very poor" performance rating;
- Enforce the group rules (see [Rules](https://sonarvrc.github.io/docs/about/rules.html) and [Rule Enforcement](https://sonarvrc.github.io/docs/guides/moderationRules.html));
- Answer questions from visitors or redirect them to the appropriate person;
- Make sure everyone is having a good time!

Try to stay mobile during your shift, making sure to cover the entire venue regularly including side areas such as spawn. You can coordinate with the other moderator on shift to work out how often you are both moderating particular areas. During times with a lot of inflow it might be useful to have one or both moderators near the entrance.

#### Avatar performance rating
By far most of your moderation interactions will be reminding people to wear an optimised avatar, and in most of these cases the person will switch upon asking. It's recommended to have a couple public optimised avatars in different styles saved to your VRChat account so you can provide one to people who don't have one themselves, there is a list of examples in the **[optimised avatars](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1443577631416123433)** thread. Some new visitors, especially those not on PC, might not know what avatar performance rating means and that it differs between platforms, see [FAQ](https://sonarvrc.github.io/docs/about/faq.html) for talking points.

#### Enforcing rules
Most of the time when someone breaks a rule or otherwise requires moderation it is because they are not aware or just forgot. For those cases, always approach someone in a friendly manner first and inform them what is going wrong. If it becomes clear they do not plan on cooperating you can use a moderation action in the following order:
- Initial verbal warning
- Instance kick
- Second verbal warning
- Group ban

Please use your own judgement on what situations require such an action. If one of these steps was needed please report this to the other moderator (through the **[#Staff com](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1257352779396288543)** voice channel) and post a message in the **[previous offenders](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1442612237486395634)** thread. If you are not sure what action is appropriate, discuss with the other moderator or escalate to a commander. If something isn't resolved during the event also report this in **[previous offenders](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1442612237486395634)**.

In some cases it can be warranted to immediately kick a person without verbal warning, but please use this sparingly and inform the other moderator of the what's and why's. Do not ban a person without a verbal warning, if you think this is necessary kick the person instead and discuss with a commander in the 30 minute cooldown this gives you.

When you inform someone of the rules they might also just decide to leave. Of course this is unfortunate, but it's very normal and not something you can or should want to prevent.

Moderation becomes a lot harder if the person in question does not speak English. If the problem is avatar performance, some venues (including Underpass) have a sign in the admin room that explains avatar rating in multiple languages, and some staff also have a print of this sign saved for use in other venues. For other moderation problems try to use text chat, find someone (staff or visitor) who can translate, or escalate to the second moderator or a commander.

#### Answering questions
Besides moderation you are also a point of contact for the SONAR group. People will come to you with questions/reports about:
- Other visitors: this is usually about moderation so handle appropriately;
- The video/audio stream: see [FAQ](https://sonarvrc.github.io/docs/about/faq.html) for troubleshooting steps. If that doesn't succeed log the problem including platform and approximate location;
- The venue: redirect these questions to someone from the world team (preferably the creator of the venue in question);
- The current event: redirect these questions to the event host;
- Future events or collabs: redirect these questions to a commander of events.

More common questions and answers can be found in [FAQ](https://sonarvrc.github.io/docs/about/faq.html).

### Ending your shift
Make sure the next moderators are in place before you end your shift and brief them of anything important from your shift, like moderator actions or raids. If the moderators who are supposed to be on shift next are not in the world, message them via the **[#mod-signup](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1266820389149868074)** thread.

## Other
### Collabs
If we're collaborating with another club the rules to enforce may be different (usually more relaxed). This will be communicated by the moderation manager for that event ahead of time in the event thread in **[#mod-signup](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1266820389149868074)**. This may also mean enrolling in a new permission system or other logistics which have to be handled at the event itself, so please be a couple minutes earlier than normal to make sure this goes smoothly.

### Swag
As staff it is nice to have the SONAR Staff logo somewhere on the avatar you use while moderating. Resources for this can be found in **[#resources](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1355315820019843092)** under the appropriate tags.

### Feedback and questions
You can always ask for feedback on your moderation from the commander of moderation or other staff. If we think something about your moderation could be improved we will say so either in (virtual) person or in a Discord DM. If you have any questions or concerns about moderation or staff matters in general please contact the commander of moderation, or if you feel uncomfortable talking to them raise the matter to another commander. If you feel a topic is important for the whole of SONAR feel free to put it in the topics list for the next commander meeting (in **[#meetings](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1449830088647507978)**) or bring it up during said meetings.

## Final word
This document is very rigourous, but in practice moderating is almost always chill time. As mentioned by far most of your moderation interactions will be about avatar performance, more serious violations are rare. Feel free to enjoy the event while you're on shift, just keep an eye out for problems and be available if a visitor or staff needs your help.
All of the SONAR staff is doing this in their free time, so try to be flexible and understanding if things change, and other staff will be flexible towards you as well. While staff with a commander role have the final say we value input from and transparency towards all staff, so feel free to participate in discussions and attend the commander meetings.

And with that, welcome aboard!
