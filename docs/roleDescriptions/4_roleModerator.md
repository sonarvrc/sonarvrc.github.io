# Role - Moderator
## Short role description
As a SONAR instance moderator, you are responsible for enforcing our group rules and norms in VRChat instances hosted by the group, as well as answering any questions visitors at our events may have.

## Requirements
Our main requirements for moderators are:
- You are at least 18 years old or age of majority in your country, whichever is higher;
- You are in the Discord server (for communication);
- You visit the events on a PC platform (Windows or Linux) (for avatar ratings and general performance);
- Your schedule is predictable enough to sign up a couple days ahead of events.
