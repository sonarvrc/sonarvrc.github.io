# SONAR XR Rules
Welcome to SONAR XR! To ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all participants, please adhere to the following rules:

1. Reason and Respect
> Use common sense and address both community and staff in a respectful and civilized manner.

2. Discrimination
> This should go without saying, discrimination based on skin color, gender, sexuality, disability, or any other grounds will be moderated and met with appropriate measures depending on severity. 

3. Politics
> Keep politics in your head and out of the conversation as good as you possibly can. Mentioning current happenings in your country/ area is fine, but larger and open discussion about it should be moved to DMs instead. We're a club, not a parliament. 

4. Age
> By joining the Discord server and our events you agree that you are at least 18 years old, and ready to prove it should staff have any doubts.

5. NSFW Content
> Despite being an 18+ community, SONAR does not allow Explicitly NSFW content; which includes, but is not limited to: nudity, the depiction of sexual acts, strong violence, and any other content that could be deemed disturbing. This also extends to avatars during our events.

6. Advertising
> Do not advertise your music, sets, or commissions outside of the **[#self-promo](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1154781701831139349)** channel. And, very certainly, ***DO NOT*** advertise directly to people via DMs.

7. Staff and Reporting
> Staff, especially **@Commander**, reserves the rights to moderate in measures that they deem appropriate, if there are any given inflictions with the above set of rules. Problems and misbehavior can be reported by opening a ticket in **[#tickets](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1163422864637169754)**.



# SONAR Rules [new version]
TODO EXPAND: The ultimate goal of these rules to is keep our chats and instances safe for everyone. We want to accomodate as many people as possible. Moderator discretion. For more examples and moderation guidelines see wiki. Rules strictly enforced during the runtime of our events. Not reading the rules is not an excuse

## Age
SONAR is a strictly 18+ group, no exceptions. This means that by being in our instances, group, or Discord server you agree you are an adult. Should staff have any doubts you may be kicked until you can provide reasonable proof of majority. 

- SONAR's VRChat instances do *not* make use of VRChat age verification because of accesibility issues, but are strictly moderated manually.
- VRChat age verification or stated age/DoB in a persons bio are usually assumed to be accurate, unless voice/behaviour very clearly says otherwise.
- In the past exceptions have been made for performers, but it has since been decided to abandon these and not allow new exceptions to be made. So: no exceptions.

## Reason and Respect
Use common sense and address community and staff in a respectful and civilised manner. SONAR aims to be a safe space, so discrimination or hostility based on race, gender, sexuality, disability, or any other grounds will be swiftly dealt with. If you do not agree with the political implications of this rule, do not join our events.

- This also includes text or visuals in names, statuses, avatars, or other parts of the VRChat or Discord profile.
- Pestering or disrespecting staff while they are doing their job will be moderated.

## Conversations and Content
Despite being an 18+ community, SONAR does not allow explicit content. This includes sexually explicit content and acts, and violent or gory material. This also extends to avatars and profile contents. We also encourage you to not discuss politics, self-harm, drug abuse, or other topics that could require a content warning. Please look out for the other members of your conversation. ***If you struggle with one of these topics, please reach out to someone you trust or a professional.***

- Enforcement of sexually explicit content is up to moderator discretion.
- ERP is a sexual act and thus not allowed. Please plan your enterprise resources elsewhere.
- If a staff member thinks a particular conversation goes too far you may be asked to move to DMs or a private instance.

## VR Etiquette
We strictly enforce avatar performance rating to be Poor or better (<:avi_poor:1470179166044295258>,<:avi_medium:1470179147522506969>, <:avi_good:1470179128614322461>, <:avi_excellent:1470179104425775250>) on PC. Do not disrupt our events for other visitors, which includes excessive avatar sounds/music, automatic chatboxes for any other purpose than accessibility, and more. Be aware of the people and space around you, avoid large avatars or crashing conversations.

- The avatar performance rule also applies to performers, unless otherwise agreed on with staff before the performance. They will be reminded to change into an optimised avatar after the performance is over.
- Some avatars with a poor or better rating might still significantly affect performance, if this is noticed staff may ask you to change.

## Advertising
We allow and encourage you to share your works-in-progress in the **[#creativity](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1147183999073124433)** and **[#music-prod](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1149098191468367933)** channels, as well as past events in the **[#debrief](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1144745997424140358)** channel. Advertising music, events, and commissions is allowed in the **[#self-promo](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1154781701831139349)** channel, messages in there should not be too long and contain no more than 3 embeds. Abuse of the channel may be moderated. **Advertising to people in DMs is interpreted as bot behaviour and will result in an instant ban.**

## Staff and Reporting
Problems and misbehavior can be reported by opening a ticket in **[#tickets](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1163422864637169754)**. Staff reserves the right to moderate with any measures they deem appropriate.
