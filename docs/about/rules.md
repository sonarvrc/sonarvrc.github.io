# SONAR XR Rules
Welcome to SONAR XR! To ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all participants, please adhere to the following rules:

1. Reason and Respect
> Use common sense and address both community and staff in a respectful and civilized manner.

2. Discrimination
> This should go without saying, discrimination based on skin color, gender, sexuality, disability, or any other grounds will be moderated and met with appropriate measures depending on severity. 

3. Politics
> Keep politics in your head and out of the conversation as good as you possibly can. Mentioning current happenings in your country/ area is fine, but larger and open discussion about it should be moved to DMs instead. We're a club, not a parliament. 

4. Age
> By joining the Discord server and our events you agree that you are at least 18 years old, and ready to prove it should staff have any doubts.

5. NSFW Content
> Despite being an 18+ community, SONAR does not allow Explicitly NSFW content; which includes, but is not limited to: nudity, the depiction of sexual acts, strong violence, and any other content that could be deemed disturbing. This also extends to avatars during our events.

6. Advertising
> Do not advertise your music, sets, or commissions outside of the **[#self-promo](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1154781701831139349)** channel. And, very certainly, ***DO NOT*** advertise directly to people via DMs.

7. Staff and Reporting
> Staff, especially **@Commander**, reserves the rights to moderate in measures that they deem appropriate, if there are any given inflictions with the above set of rules. Problems and misbehavior can be reported by opening a ticket in **[#tickets](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1163422864637169754)**.
