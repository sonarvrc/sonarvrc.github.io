# SONAR XR Frequently Asked Questions

## Age restriction
### Why is SONAR 18+?
We want to create a space for adult conversations where participants don't have to take potentially underage listeners into account.

### Why are SONAR instances not age-gated?
There are many reasons people aren't able to or don't want to be age-verified, including privacy, legal status, and geo-blocks. We want to include such people at SONAR, age-gating our instances would block them from our events entirely.

## Avatar performance
### What is the avatar performance rating?
It's the red/yellow/green bubble that all avatars have, shown in the avatar selection and on nameplates. It shows how much lag that avatar creates for other people. A red bubble with an exclamation mark means the performance rating is "very poor".

### Why am I seeing a different performance rating than someone else?
The performance rating of the PC, Android (Quest), and iOS versions of the same avatar can be different. In the avatar details you can see the rating for each platform. We moderate based on the rating on PC.

### Why do we enforce avatar performance?
We want everyone to have a relatively smooth experience without having to block people. This is good for visitors because there is a better sense of shared space, which encourages people to be more social. It is also good for the performers as they usually can't block/show people during their performance.

### But avatar performance rating is useless!
The rating is indeed not very accurate but most of the time it's a decent approximation. Checking the stats manually or even measuring the exact impact of an individual avatar is not feasible in large instances.

## Performing
### Can I DJ here tonight?
Probably! After the scheduled slots at our regular Open Decks events anyone is allowed to play, but please register with the event host so they can keep this in mind. Note that these extra slots are not moderated.

### Can I DJ here some other time?
Yes! Please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/xwvGcFZpee), sign-ups for Open Decks are announced there. Make sure to grab the DJ role to get access to the **[#dj-talk](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1154452716710531146)** and **[#open-decks-signups](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1218139169558368307)** channels.

### Can I give some other performance at SONAR? (eg dancer, VJ, LD)
We don't usually have other types of performance at Open Decks, but at our special events we regularly have openings. Feel free to make yourself known to staff!

## Other
### The stream is lagging/stopped/broken!
All SONAR venues have a local resync button somewhere accessible, usually near the settings panel or the DJ. Clicking this fixes most stream problems, if not, check unknown URLs are enabled in the VRChat settings and try rejoining. If that still doesn't solve the issue and/or multiple people are having problems please notify a staff member in the instance, they'll help you further. Note that SONAR venues currently don't officially support iOS.

### Someone broke a rule or made me uncomfortable
Please talk to staff in the instance or make a ticket in the Discord server (**[#tickets](https://discord.com/channels/1144683882336231524/1163422864637169754)**). Please only send a Discord DM to a specific staff member if the report concerns another staff member.
